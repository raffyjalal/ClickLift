### Obtaining the source.
```
git clone https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/fds23/62/team-16/clicklift
cd clicklift
```

### Installing Yarn
```
npm install -g yarn
```

### Building for Development
Make sure you are using `yarn` instead of `npm`. We have found that `npm` causes issues.
Once in the project directory, you can run:
```
yarn install
yarn run start
```

This will bring you to the Expo cli where you can then choose to open the project in an emulator or through the Expo Go app.
